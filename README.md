# Koko Parking
Welcome to the latest neighborhood parking app. This app was first envisioned by Team SPCS at DBC btw. Dec. 10 and Dec. 18, 2015. I am renaming this project to Koko Parking, and I will redevelop this app from ground zero.

For original project, please visit https://github.com/nyc-bobolinks-2015/drivewaze.

Files in this project are grouped by feature instead of file type. For application files, please look inside app/assets/javascripts
